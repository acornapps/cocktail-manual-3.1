This feature allows you to execute a build task. When a build is executed, application download, application build, and image build are performed all at once.

### a\) Service → Build Management → Build Action Menu \(Activate\) → Build Run

### b\) The current action changes, and the log window becomes activated at build time.

### When the build is created, tabs become activated according to the number selected via checkboxes, allowing you to check the build process for each step.

**\(If an error occurs during the download step, the next step will not be performed.\)**

### The message "Application_Create_Image Step is done..." indicates that the image build was successfully completed.
